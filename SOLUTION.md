# Solution
1. server.rs
Bug Fixes and Improvements:

Thread Pool Management: Ensured that the thread pool is properly joined during server shutdown to wait for all tasks to complete, preventing potential resource leaks.
Logging Enhancements: Added logging to track client connections, disconnections, and message processing, which helps in debugging and understanding server behavior.
Non-blocking I/O: Set the server to non-blocking mode and used a short sleep to reduce CPU usage when no connections are available, improving performance.

2. client.rs
Bug Fixes and Improvements:

Connection Management: Improved error handling in the connect and disconnect methods to provide more informative error messages and ensure resources are properly cleaned up.
Logging Enhancements: Added logging for sending and receiving messages to track client-server communication, aiding in debugging.
Error Handling: Enhanced error messages for decoding failures to provide more context about what went wrong, making it easier to diagnose issues.

3. Test File
Bug Fixes and Improvements:

Server Lifecycle Management: Ensured that the server is properly stopped and the server thread is joined after each test, preventing tests from hanging and ensuring resources are cleaned up.
Logging in Tests: Added logging within tests to provide more context during execution, helping to identify where a test might be failing or hanging.
Error Messages in Assertions: Improved error messages in assertions to provide more context about what went wrong, making test failures easier to diagnose.
General Improvements Across Files
Consistent Logging: Used consistent logging practices across all files to provide a clear execution trail and facilitate debugging.
Resource Management: Ensured that all resources, such as network connections and threads, are properly managed and cleaned up to prevent leaks and ensure stability.
Error Handling: Improved error handling throughout the code to provide more informative messages and handle edge cases more gracefully.
These changes collectively enhance the robustness, maintainability, and debuggability of your server-client application.
